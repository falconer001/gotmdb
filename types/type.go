package types

// This is a notice::
// I don't know how to use go generate, so i tried to add the types manually.
// Unfortunately, the types are enormous, so i let AI generate them for me (All types in this folder).
// I will try to adjust incorrect types and add comments to explain them, but i don't promise anything.
// This was frustrating.
